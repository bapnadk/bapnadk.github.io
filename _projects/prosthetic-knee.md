<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study aims to identify the best possible material for production of liners for prosthetic limbs. Based on the standard Galerkin finite element method in space and Crank-Nicolson difference method in time, the semi-discrete and fully discrete systems are constructed. The code is written in C++ and MATLAB, and deformation plots of different loading conditions for different materials are analyzed. The code is a general approach written for a (n x m) meshing domain and can be refined as per the user preference based on the desired accuracy. The code was validated with simulations on ANSYS Static Structural providing a green signal for further research. Further work to incorporate the nonlinear constitutive behavior of silicone will be done to test whether silicone is really the best economic material in the market available.
