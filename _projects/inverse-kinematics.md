<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spatially hyper redundant systems have more number of controllable Degrees of Freedom (DOF) as compared to their actual DOF. These systems have infinite number of solutions for a given state space reach making it complex to develop proper inverse kinematic solution. Adapting the optimization methods only help to arrive at the promising Inverse Kinematic (IK) solution. The second part of the project involves implementation and simulation of computed torque control method for a 2-DOF manipulator using MATLAB/Simulink. Computed Torque Control is a powerful non-linear controller which uses feedback linearisation to compute the required arm torques required for movement. The robot model is designed using the SimMechanics library of Simulink.
