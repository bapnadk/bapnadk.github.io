**[** July 22, 2018 **]** Presentation of my project with Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research (IGCAR).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) Steam Generator inspection device has two link robotic arm which is used to inspect any crack or flaw  in the tube. A PFBR steam generator has 547 tubes connecting the top and the bottom headers. Sodium is flowing outside the tube. High pressure water is flowing inside the tube. For this a 2-R planar robotic arm is used. **[**[More here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Xf4_fRxvhsm00X7ydIDEePB0wVk8pl0/view?usp=sharing)**]**
