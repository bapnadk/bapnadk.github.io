**[** February 04, 2020 **]** Invited talk on placement and internships - preparation, challenges, and the journey after.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placements are undeniably an important part of college and keeping that in mind, BITS Embryo organised a talk on this subject delivered by students who have experienced the process firsthand. I spoke about focusing on preparing for technical interviews and programming rounds while referencing Hackerearth for theory, GeeksforGeeks for an exhaustive question bank, and Leetcode for learning how to write clean code. **[**[More here](https://embryobits.wordpress.com/2020/02/18/placement-talk-2/)**]**
