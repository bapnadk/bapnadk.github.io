**[** February 13, 2020 **]** Invited talk on my journey through college and the endless opportunities that it entails. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of my undergraduate life I was introduced to all the possible paths that an engineering college could offer - finance, mechanical engineering, computer science and business. Thanks to BITS Pilani's Unique 0% attendance policy, I was able to find plenty of time to explore each of them while balancing my grades and other responsibilities. Fast forwarding through the 4 years, I worked on designing the pod-vehicle for Hyperloop India, devised closed-loop control models and algorithms for trajectory optimization and researched about modeling autonomous-vehicle states as Markov chains.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting out in the first year, I mainly focused on my GPA and interacting with seniors and professors. I spent learning about their research and career path, and why they chose to do what they did. In my second year, I took up a couple of projects spanning computational fluid dynamics, robotics and machine learning - trying to see what excited me the most. My Junior year was mostly spent in researching about graduate schools since I have always been a keen learner and the idea of exploring a field to its depth is exciting and intimidating at the same time - and I for one have always loved a steep ascent. Coming from a mechanical engineering background, it might seem difficult to manage computer science projects while preparing for GRE simultaneously but because I was so keen on exploring the field I enjoyed the adventure thoroughly. In the summer after my Junior year, I felt like I had built a strong foundation of mathematics and machine learning, and hence decided to intern at Microsoft Research before going for my thesis at Carnegie Mellon University in my Senior year. Those 6 months at CMU were a roller-coaster but that's an experience for another day. **[**[More here](https://embryobits.wordpress.com/2019/02/18/gre-and-gmat-talk/)**]**
