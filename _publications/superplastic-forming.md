<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper presents a review on the superplastic forming of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, which has been used to manufacture parts of complex shapes and geometries. This paper outlines the major work carried out on this front in the past three decades. It covers various aspects related to experimental setups, including the manufacture of dies and their modifications to maintain alloy thickness uniformity after forming. A detailed study of the process parameters has also been done to note the most important physical conditions required for successful forming. This is followed by the influence of microstructure, modern applications of superplastic forming of different titanium alloys and is concluded with an insight into the future work and progress in this field. **[**[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1909/1909.05011.pdf)**]**
