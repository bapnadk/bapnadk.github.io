I am currently a Quantitative Researcher at [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/markets/global-equities) working towards devising pricing models for structured derivative payoffs. Prior to this, I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Ding Zhao](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dingzhao/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dingzhao/) on indoor SLAM and LiDAR sensor optimization for my undergraduate thesis. During Summer '19 and '18, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and [Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research](http://www.igcar.gov.in/) working on reinforcement learning and closed-loop control algorithms.

I like to focus on problems which closely impact our community and my work till now has been focused on understanding the nature of these problems. I am interested in solutions which build on machine learning, statistics, applied probability, optimization, and simulation. 

In addition to always looking to [learn](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) and [solve](/projects) problems, I like photography and working for the community. During my undergraduate years at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) I founded [Bumbling.Tumbling.Clicking.](https://www.bumblingtumblingclicking.in/) through which we worked towards promoting volunteering spirit and active citizenship among the youth.
